Quality Check Required Before Delivery
Before sending your final design to the customer, you must use the /qualitycheck command and submit your work for review.

This ensures we maintain high standards and deliver top-quality work every time.
If you're unsure how to use the command, feel free to ask a team lead or HR for help.

Assets

Asset Usage Guidelines
You are allowed to use assets provided in #assets by Concept Customs staff, as well as any assets you’ve created or personally own.
However, you may not claim assets made by others as your own, whether they come from Concept Customs or outside sources.
Always give credit where it’s due, and only use materials you have the rights to. Misuse of assets can lead to warnings or removal from the team.
If you're unsure whether an asset is allowed, ask a lead before using it.

Mandatory Order & Quality Control Procedures

All designers are reminded that, effective immediately, they must log all customer orders without applying tax. Additionally, every item you create must be fully quality controlled before it is handed off to the customer. These steps are mandatory and are in place to ensure accuracy, professionalism, and consistency in our customer experience.
If, for any reason, the payment verification does not come through or fails to send, you are required to ping @rally_boy143 directly to confirm whether the customer has actually paid. No items should be delivered or moved forward without confirmed payment.
Once you’ve completed the order, ping @rally_boy143 or @harisfnihg to send the "Thank you message" at the end. The submission must include everything that was ordered—no partial or incomplete deliveries. All codes associated with the order must also be sent together at the end of the order, to ensure the customer receives everything they need in one place and for proper recordkeeping.
Failure to follow any of these steps—including incorrect tax logging, skipping quality control, not verifying payment, or submitting incomplete orders—will result in a two-day suspension. If you have any questions or are unsure about the process, please speak with me or your supervisor before proceeding. Thank you for your attention to these important procedures. Also, please use /customer and choose the customer that paid for the items. Also log the order at the end of the order without tax!

Claiming Orders

Designers are allowed to claim only two orders at a time to ensure quality and fairness across the team. Once a designer completes their current order and it is officially closed, they can then claim a new one. 
This system is in place not only to maintain focused, high-quality work but also to give all designers an equal opportunity to access available orders. 
By limiting claims to one order at a time, the process stays organized and promotes a fair distribution of work among all team members. Claiming more than one will result in punishment.

Reminder Logs

When logging orders without tax in ⁠order-logs you should log the order the original price without tax. 
Designers should use the /paymentedit command, which sets the game pass to the specified amount, ensuring the customer pays the correct amount.
It’s important that designers log their own orders properly, if you fail to do so and the customer proceeds with payment, the designer becomes ineligible for payment until the order is properly logged using the /orderlog command and the /tax command is applied to account for any tax requirements. 
This process ensures accurate tracking of sales and payments while maintaining compliance with tax regulations. All orders should be completed within 4 days unless there are loads to do. You can get this extended by contacting a HR member.
